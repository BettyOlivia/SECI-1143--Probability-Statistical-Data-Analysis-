# SECI-1143-Probability-Statistical-Data-Analysis

## Course Overview  <br> 
This course introduced me to various statistical techniques used to analyze data effectively. At the start, I learned about different types of data and variables from everyday and industrial sources. The course emphasized visual data representation to better understand the information. We explored parameter estimation methods for different probability distributions and conducted hypothesis testing to analyze data sets. Additionally, I learned how to apply statistical models to fit data groups. By the end of the course, I was able to use statistical software to perform data analysis and interpret results with confidence.
